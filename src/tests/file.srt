Can we pretend like airplanes

1
00:00:013,407 --> 00:00:014,399
In the night sky are like shooting stars

2
00:00:014,499 --> 00:00:016,578
I could realy use a wish right now

3
00:00:016,678 --> 00:00:017,999
Wish right now

4
00:00:018,099 --> 00:00:019,690
Wish right now

5
00:00:019,790 --> 00:00:021,971
Could we pretend like airplanes

6
00:00:022,071 --> 00:00:024,946
In the night sky are like shooting stars

7
00:00:025,046 --> 00:00:027,754
I could realy use a wish right now

8
00:00:027,854 --> 00:00:029,136
wish right now

9
00:00:029,236 --> 00:00:030,558
wish right now

10
00:00:030,658 --> 00:00:035,574
And it seems like yesterday

11
00:00:035,674 --> 00:00:037,216
It was just a dream

12
00:00:037,316 --> 00:00:039,661
Those days are gone
